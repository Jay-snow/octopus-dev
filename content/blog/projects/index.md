In my last blog entry, I praised the methodology of plowing ahead even in uncertainty.

The post has a celebratory note to it - I was very proud that I managed to assemble this blog despite not understanding most of the code involved.

I was also simultaneously pushing out a new feature - pagination. If this website is going to act as my portfolio, I thought, I need to start working on it.

My attempt at pagination broke my website so horrendously, I finally learned how to restore an old version from Git. Hours of tinkering and testing gone, I had to completely abandon ship.

And despite this, I *still* believe in ship first learn later. Because in breaking my website, I learned even more.
