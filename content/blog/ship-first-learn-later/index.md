I have finally added pagination to my blog!

How does it work *exactly*? Well, I actually can't answer that. I can tell you how it works vaguely, but the specifics are still a mystery to me.

Even though this website is built with Gatsby and ReactJs, I don't actually __know__ either. And that's perfeclty OK. It took me a long time to become OK with things I don't understand,
 and I'm still learning that.

In college, I was derailed by "public static void main".

"What on earth does that mean?"

"Don't worry about that for now." Was every professor's response. I spent far too much time in textbooks and online trying to divine it's meaning. If I couldn't understand what I saw as the basics, how would
I ever learn to write code?

If you're a code noobie and you try to research "public static void main", you're gonna have a bad time. All it did was increase my anxiety - I'd be led to more and more subjects that I didn't understand.

"Wait, what is a method?"
"Classes? Like with CSS? This looks completely different."
"Objects? Ok now I'm really getting confused."

So of course I'd try to research methods, classses, and object-oriented programming, and try to loop back around to "public static void main". All because of a simple "Hello World" assignment that should have taken 5 minutes.

I used to pride myself on this, but I grew to see it as a weakness. It was impossible to absorb everything and keep it in memory.

Now I have a much different approach toward projects. Over time I realized that if you just shutup and code, you'll learn a lot along the way. You won't understand everything right away, but that's OK.

Thanks to this blog, I've now learned:
1. What npm install means, and how to use node to install packages.
2. What netlify is, and why people think it's so great.
3. What Markdown is
4. How a react project looks and feels.
5. How a Gatsby project looks and feels.
6. How to use VIM (This entry was actually written in VIM!)

Which is amazing! If I had thought "Well, to make this blog I'm going to need to learn everything about ReactJS and Gatsby", I would still be doing tutorials and reading documentation. 

I think this can be referred to as "Hands on learning.".
