I am a big fan of personal challenges and setting goals. For me they aren't just something to do for fun or because you are bored. They are a brain hack - a way to force a certain mindfulness into your everyday. Are you closer to your goal or farther away? What's stopping you from reaching your goal? These are the sort of mindful questions that arise from setting goals.

Goals can be tricky. I feel pretty comfortable saying that *most* goals are not achieved. They are either too ambitious, or the discipline isn't really there. A lot of goals sit around collecting dust - a product of "I'll do it later"ism. 

I got really into goal setting in college. That was where I first started to program, and I don't think I would have made it anywhere without setting tons of small programming jobs. When I graduated, my goal-setting ways came with me. One of my first jobs out of college was as an Online Marketing Manager. Soon all of my goals fell into one of two camps:
1) Work-Oriented goals
2) Marketing-Oriented goals

After work, I'd spend time reading work productivity books like Eat The Frog or time-tested web design books like Don't Make Me Think. I learned how to create and manage e-mail campaigns, track e-mail performance with UTM's, and how to build a list. I got certified in Google Analytics, mastered amorpheous field of SEO , and refined my writing style to be more marketing-friendly. I earned over $20,000 annually in Google Adwords all by my lonesome. I met and tutored other companies on how to incorporate google ads into their business.

I also learned that I did not like marketing. I tried to make the best of it for a long time - marketing and sales are very valuable sklils to learn. I was thankful to have something right out of college, and I truly loved my co-workers. But the type of challenges marketing poses weren't satisfying to solve. Finding partners or creating yet-another-promotional page left me wanting for more. But what?

In 2017, my mom died suddenly at the age of 60. With no forewarning or signs of illness, she passed within in a few months. This is when I began to think much more critically about my life, and what I was doing with it. 

In 2018 I set one major goal for the following year: Stay sane and keep my job. It was a hard, long year. I somehow maintained, though by the end of the year I was a complete insomniac. 

By Jan 2019, I had completed my only goal. And I felt miserable. I couldn't get myself psyche'd up for work anymore. Even worse, when I thought about my future career, a lifetime of online marketing, I'd start to sweat. 

I ended up leaving my job the following month with nothing lined up. The first few days off work were tough. I had told myself I'd give myself one week to do anything - play video games, drink, watch tv, just hangout. But all I accomplished in two days was nervously pacing around my apartment I realized my mind was still buzzing to check emails, check social media, check my instant messages. But I didn't have any of those things to check. 

"Ok." I took a deep breathe "You have one goal for the day. Take a nap."

It seemed sort of silly at first. I laid down in bed, and quickly my head was a swarm of thoughts. Was it really a good idea to quit my job? Did I tie up all my loose ends? Damn I hope they don't have any troubles with the next podcast episode, we just changed the landing page so the process is different. 

I took another deep breathe, and could cleanly see myself now. I was a nervous wreck. I had focused so much on work the last year, work was all I became. My identity and my wellbeing were completely tied to the ebbs and flow of work. Several 50 hour weeks had burned the last of my resolve. 

I ended up falling asleep. A short nap. My next goal was to clean - how did my apartment get so dirty?

A few months later, and I've become goal-driven again:

- I've attended my first hackation
- I went to the beach for the first time in 20 years
- I taught myself PHP and mySQL to create a twitter-clone
- I became vegetarian and learned how to cook the best banana pancakes you'll ever eat
- I flew and crashed my first drone ever

All of these were goals of mine, and they keep coming! I'm currently trying to run 5 miles a week, and today I'm committing to 300 words a day. This entry is already over 600 words, so I'm off to a good start!
