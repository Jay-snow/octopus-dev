I'm embarssed to admit that I just recently learned what Markdown is. Until a few weeks ago, I thought *Markdown* 
referred to your own style of writing documentation. I think somewhere down the line I got it conflated with markup.

Markdown is a styling system invented by John Gruber. This blog is my first time using Markdown, and it has been a real joy.
It really helps keep the focus on writing.

However I'm still learning, so I wanted to make myself a simple cheatsheet. Here are the markdown elements I find myself using the most.

##Headers

You can make the `h1`...`h5` tags by doing the following:

# H1 `code: # H1`
## H2 `code: ## H2`
### H3 `code: ### H3`
#### H4 `code: #### H4`
##### H5 `code: ##### H5`


##Emphasis

__Bold__: You can bold text by placing two underscores around text (e.g. `__bold__`)

*Italics*: You can italicize text by placing asterisks around text (e.g. `*italics*`)

~~Strike through~~: You can strike through text by using tilda's around text (e.g. `~strike through~`)

##Link and Images

[Link:](https://www.google.com) `code: [Title](https://www.google.com)`


![Adorable Kitten](adorable-kitten.jpg)  `code: ![Alt Text](file-location.jpeg)`

##Blockquote

>You miss 100% of the shots you don't take. Or something like that.

`code: > text`


## Conclusion

These are the markdown styles I find myself using the most. I have found writing in Markdown to be a pure joy, and I never want to go back.
