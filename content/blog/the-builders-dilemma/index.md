title: "Making Stuff"

One thing that I've always liked from an early age is making "stuff". I'd make short comics, write stories with my brother, and even made stop-motion pictures using the family camera.

When we got our first computer in the 90's, my production of "stuff" exploded. But my completion of "stuff" dwindled down to nearly nothing. My many ambitious projects often didn't last much past the planning stages. After 2-3 days writing a story or drawing a comic, I'd switch to something else. I managed to create a few things, like a few flash movies and a couple of games. I even made a Let's Play series when I was in college.

A happy byproduct of being digital focused, is that there's a few copies of my past creations lingering about, though most have been most to time.* With a compute and the internet, it's pretty easy to jump into any hobby, whether it's making movies, writing, music, - really anything you have the patience for. 

This has translated into massive decision-paralysis for me. I always have had a hard time deciding what to make next. In fact this is usually where the period I stay at longest, a state of hesitation deciding what to build next. Should I make another animation? Should I make another Warcraft 3 custom mod? 

As a hobbyist-hoping-to-be-professional programmer, this decision-paralysis has been magnified in my programming life.. What should I build next? What language should I use - I've always wanted to try -insert_language_here-, but I've also been meaning to check out -another_language-. Right now I'm deciding between a Zork-style text adventure written in Javascript and a SC2 add-on written in C#. 

At the beginning of this year, I committed to better learning Javascript. I've now had about 5 months of Javascript practice, and I have learned a lot. I recently made a Twitter clone using Javascript, PHP, and mySQL. I had never used PHP and mySQL, and it was pretty fun learning and using two new things completely. I learned how databases work and how to interact with them, how to salt passwords, how to create users and a login system, how to template a page (I even sort of learned this by accident).

I've been a Web Developer for so long because of the ease of getting things done, and the feeling of accomplishment of throwing together a web page in a weekend. But I've really barely scratched the surface of programming language - doesn't it make some since to shop around and find what I like? My last project demonstrated to me how much -more- you can learn when taking on something completely new. I wasn't even sure I would be able to make what I set out to, and maybe that's why it felt so rewarding.

Well I think I've made my decision then. How hard can image recognition be anyway?

*<small> A side project I've thought about for eons now is scavenging the internet to collect all my various projects. As much as I love Newgrounds and Youtube, who knows if one day their servers won't implode or something. Mark my word this project will take place one day! </small>
